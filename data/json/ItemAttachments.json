When deployed, gravity mines create a localized area of intense gravity that can reduce the output of repulsorlift drives or even shut them down completely, stopping a speeder in its tracks. While they are often used in military installations to restrict ship or vehicle access to sensitive areas or to create firing lanes for weapon emplacements, they can also be used in sabotage or to lay traps for incoming ships or airspeeders.
